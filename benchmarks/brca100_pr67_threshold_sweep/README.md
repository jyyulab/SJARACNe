# BRCA100 PR67 per-subsample threshold sweep

This benchmark varies only PR67's seed-level AP-MI `-p` value.  It keeps the
following fixed:

- PR67 commit `7633ebb4a0d966dbda15a4e32d0efa492fb71aeb`;
- estimator-matched model `m=80`, `Npar=40`, SHA-256
  `e3a8522682a8ea239821aaa10b12db72d00e07bfdcad43599d8e76a06be80944`;
- fixed 80% sampling without replacement;
- BRCA100 expression, TF and SIG lists;
- seeds 1 through 100;
- adaptive-partitioning MI, `Npar=40`, and DPI epsilon 0; and
- consensus-network `p=1e-5`.

Biological-reference validation is intentionally deferred.  This sweep asks
whether a less stringent seed-level operating point restores usable driver
coverage and graph connectivity while retaining reasonable consensus support.
The results are descriptive network QC, not proof of biological accuracy.

## Results

The original nine-point, independently audited sweep is summarized in
[results_2026-08-19/RESULTS.md](results_2026-08-19/RESULTS.md). It nominates
`p=3e-4` only as a provisional BRCA100 topology operating point. The appended
four-point extension addresses the separate concern that its median regulon
sizes may be too small for robust downstream activity estimation.

## Grid

| Seed-level p | AP-MI cutoff | Calibration status | Purpose |
|---:|---:|---|---|
| `1e-7` | 0.322465 | GPD extrapolation | original PR67 default |
| `1e-6` | 0.288001 | GPD extrapolation | coarse grid |
| `1e-5` | 0.247951 | GPD extrapolation | coarse grid |
| `2e-5` | 0.234669 | directly tested; validation boundary | first directly tested point |
| `5e-5` | 0.216162 | directly tested on held-out stream | coarse grid |
| `1e-4` | 0.201409 | directly tested on held-out stream | coarse grid |
| `2e-4` | 0.185973 | directly tested on held-out stream | coarse grid |
| `3e-4` | 0.176615 | interpolated inside accepted validation range | near PR66 density anchor |
| `3.528045626e-4` | 0.172803 | interpolated inside accepted validation range | exact PR66-cutoff match |
| `4e-4` | 0.169824 | interpolated inside accepted validation range | extended density sweep |
| `5e-4` | 0.164467 | directly tested on held-out stream | extended density sweep |
| `7.5e-4` | 0.154532 | interpolated inside accepted validation range | extended density sweep |
| `1e-3` | 0.147322 | directly tested on held-out stream | extended density sweep |

The final probability is calculated from the PR67 GPD model so that its MI
cutoff equals PR66's legacy affine cutoff at `m=80`.  PR66 remains context, not
ground truth.

The four appended points examine larger regulons after the original topology
screen produced median TF and SIG target counts that were considered too low
for the intended activity-estimation use. No biological or activity-robustness
criterion is applied here. The extension reports the fraction of all
zero-filled candidate drivers with at least 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100 targets,
both overall and after requiring recurrence support of at least 20%, 50%, or
80%. Recurrence is a stability diagnostic, not an edge probability or FDR.

Here, Gate 2 means validation against a second, independent stream of
canonical rank permutations generated under the AP-MI independence null.  It
is not a held-out BRCA cohort, a biological-reference test, or downstream
NetBID reproducibility.

Every point is inferred directly with `-p ... -M ...`.  The benchmark does not
filter or replay a looser adjacency matrix: stored adjacency MIs have limited
decimal precision, and DPI is applied after seed-level thresholding.

## Persistent execution

Run from WSL using the already pinned NetBID2 environment.  The work root is on
the persistent native-ext4 home filesystem, not `/tmp`.

The runner writes an immutable `sweep_design.json`, one `point_manifest.json`
per probability, checksummed seed metadata, a cumulative `run_manifest.tsv`,
consensus manifests, and an invocation history.  Completed jobs are accepted on
resume only after their command fingerprint, headers, structure, and adjacency
SHA-256 are revalidated.

An existing completed nine-point v1 root is extended only through the explicit
append-only v1-to-v2 migration. The runner first proves that the complete v1
design and every existing point manifest match the pinned historical contract,
archives the exact old design under `sweep_design_history/`, records a
fingerprinted migration manifest, and only then atomically promotes the
13-point design. Any changed invariant, reordered point, orphan manifest, or
pre-existing extension path fails closed.

The NetBID2 runner discovers points only from immutable
`results/<point>/point_manifest.json` files. Compact artifacts live under each
arm's `netbid2_qc/`; optional reports live separately under
`netbid2_qc_html/`. Both modes use input-and-environment fingerprints, pending
manifests, atomic directory promotion, and complete file inventories for safe
resume and narrow-window crash recovery. The all-arm summary run writes stable
provenance to `results/netbid2_qc_manifest.json`. A later HTML run requires that
exact complete summary aggregate, never rewrites it, and writes optional-report
provenance to `results/netbid2_qc_html_manifest.json` instead.

Because NetBID arm fingerprints include the global sweep-design hash, the v2
extension does not silently accept the old records. Each existing summary or
HTML record is first revalidated against the archived v1 hash, command,
environment, logs, and current output bytes. Its exact old manifest is archived
under `netbid2_manifest_history/`; the active record is then rewritten by
changing only the design hash and fingerprint. A deterministic migration audit
records every such transition.

## Compact results package

After the full analysis succeeds, create a reviewable package outside the live
work root.  The destination and its sibling `.partial` path must not exist.

```bash
PACKAGE="$ROOT/benchmarks/brca100_pr67_threshold_sweep/results_extended_2026-08-19"
"$RUN" python \
  "$ROOT/benchmarks/brca100_pr67_threshold_sweep/package_results.py" \
  --work-root "$WORK" --output-root "$PACKAGE"
```

The packager requires the exact 13-point by 2-driver design, 2,600 completed
seed runs, both completed full-run invocations, 400 anchor comparisons, all
consensus/support artifacts, all 26 NetBID2 summaries, and a completed analysis
with exact PR66 cutoff-match evidence.  It copies the compact analysis tables
and plots, anchor evidence, and immutable design/build/point/arm/aggregate
manifests.  Optional HTML manifests are included only when their root aggregate
is complete.  Each optional per-arm record must reproduce the exact
`run_netbid_qc.py` input fingerprint and command contract, and its three shared
TSVs must be byte-identical to the already validated stable summary outputs.

Raw adjacencies, full consensus networks, support tables, NetBID2 data products,
and HTML reports are never copied.  `omitted_artifacts.json` preserves their
validated hashes and sizes.  The packager rereads every omitted regular file;
it rejects a current SHA-256 mismatch and also rejects a byte-count mismatch
where the producing manifest records one.  `.gitattributes` disables text
conversion, and `SHA256SUMS` covers every package file except itself.  The
script intentionally
does not invent a `RESULTS.md`; add the reviewed numerical report later and
regenerate `SHA256SUMS` with the `write_sha256s()` helper in
`package_results.py`.

## Interpretation

The pragmatic topology screen was declared before inspecting the intermediate
sweep points, but after observing the PR66 and PR67 endpoint networks; it is
therefore endpoint-informed, not a neutral preregistration.  It nominates the
smallest, most stringent `p` in the held-out validation range for which **both**
TF and SIG consensus networks have
at least 90% active candidate drivers, at least 70% of all expression nodes
incident to an edge, and at least 95% of incident nodes in the largest weak
component.  These are engineering non-collapse floors, not statistically or
biologically optimal cutoffs.  If no point passes, the sweep reports that no
operating point was found rather than relaxing the floors after inspecting the
results.  Any nominated value is a provisional topology operating point.  The
coverage-connectivity knee, adjacent-threshold overlap, and support are
secondary diagnostics rather than additional pass/fail gates.

The topology screen always chooses the smallest, most stringent passing `p`;
whether that point was directly tested in Gate 2 or interpolated within the
accepted range is reported but does not justify skipping it. The extended
target-size summaries are descriptive. They do not define a density optimum or
change the provisional topology operating point without a separately declared
regulon-density or downstream-robustness criterion.

At minimum, report consensus edges, active-driver fraction, zero-filled target
sizes, incident-node fraction, weak components, largest-component fraction,
MI, support, and adjacent-threshold overlap.  Scale-free adjusted R-squared
alone must not select the operating point: the original extremely sparse PR67
SIG network had a high value despite severe driver and connectivity loss.
Support summaries are conditional on an edge surviving the consensus filter;
they are not edge-inclusion probabilities or uncertainty intervals.  Plot IQR
bands describe distributions across the retained edges, not confidence
intervals or variation across independent benchmark datasets.

The sweep does not establish biological optimality, empirical FDR, or
independent-cohort NetBID reproducibility.  Those require a later biological
validation phase.
