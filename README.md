# SJARACNe

SJARACNe is a scalable solution of ARACNe that dramatically improves the computational 
performance, especially on the memory usage to allow even researchers with modest 
computational power to generate networks from thousands of samples. The algorithm uses 
adaptive partitioning mutual information to calculate the correlation between all pairs 
of genes to reconstruct the regulatory network. 
SJARACNe is now integrated into our latest framework, [scMINER](https://jyyulab.github.io/scMINER/), 
for single-cell RNA-seq data analysis.

## Create a virtual environment (recommended)
### Using conda to create a virtual environment 
The recommended method of setting up the required Python environment and dependencies is to use the
[conda](https://conda.io/en/latest/) dependency manager:

```bash
$ conda create -n py392 python=3.9.2
$ source activate py392
```

## Installation
Depends on the runtime environment, [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) may be installed manually to run 
cwltool locally; [cwlexec](https://github.com/yuch7/cwlexec) may be installed manually to run on IBM LSF platform. 

There are two options to install SJARACNe and its dependencies:
### (Option 1) Install via pip
```$ pip install SJARACNe```

### (Option 2) Install from source
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jyyulab/SJARACNe
$ cd SJARACNe
$ python setup.py build     # build SJARACNe binary
$ python setup.py install
```

### Install optional packages depends on runtime platform
SJARACNe workflow is implemented in [Common Workflow Language](https://www.commonwl.org/). 
Install node.js for running locally using cwltool; install cwlexec to run on IBM LSF platform. 
Users may check [Common Workflow Language](https://www.commonwl.org/) site for available workflow engines 
to run on other platforms, e.g., [Toil](https://toil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


## Usage
```$ sjaracne 
usage: sjaracne [-h] {local,lsf} ...

SJARACNe is a scalable tool for gene network reverse engineering.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit

Subcommands:
  {local,lsf}  platforms
    local      run cwltool in a local workstation
    lsf        run cwlexec as in a IBM LSf cluster
```
```sjaracne``` workflow is implemented with [CWL](https://www.commonwl.org/). It supports multiple
 computing platforms. We have tested it locally using [cwltool](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool) 
 and on an IBM LSF cluster using [cwlexec](https://github.com/IBMSpectrumComputing/cwlexec). 
 For the convenience, a python wrapper is developed for you to choose computing platform using ```subcommand```.
 
The local mode (sjaracne local) runs in parallel by default using cwltool's --parallel option. To run it in serial, 
use --serial option.

To use LSF mode, editing the LSF-specific configuration file SJARACNe/config/config_cwlexec.json to change the default 
queue and adjust memory reservation for each step is necessary. Consider increasing memory reservation for the resampling
step and consensus step if the dimension of your expression matrix file is large.


### Inputs
The main input for SJARACNe is a tab-separated genes/protein by cells/samples expression matrix
with the first two columns being ID and symbol. The second required input file is the list of
significant genes/proteins IDs to be considered as hubs in the reconstructed network (**the most recent version of curated 
transcription factors and signaling proteins can be found in ./SJARACNe/config/TF_list.txt and ./SJARACNe/config/SIG_list.txt, respectively**). 
An output directory is required for storing output files. Additional parameters (e.g., LSF queue) for running on different platforms are required. 
Those are available in the helping information of the corresponding subcommands, e.g., ```sjaracne lsf -h```.


### Outputs
The main output of SJARACNe is a network file, which is a tab delimited text file with the following columns: source,
target, mutual information, Pearson and Spearman correlations coefficients, regression line slope and p-value. SJARACNe
also outputs two meta information files: parameter_info_.txt and bootstrap_info_.txt, which store SJARACNe
input parameters and resampling metadata, respectively. `bootstrap_info_.txt` is retained as a legacy filename.

### Consensus edge recurrence

By default, the consensus step retains an ordered edge when it appears in at
least six distinct resampled networks (`-k 6`). The comparison is inclusive,
so an edge with support exactly six is retained. Each run records the selected
minimum recurrence, the number of input networks, and their ratio in
`bootstrap_info_.txt` and `parameter_info_.txt`.

Use `-k` / `--min-recurrence` to choose another positive integer. The requested
value cannot exceed `-n` / `--bootstrap-num`; workflows with fewer than six
networks must therefore set a feasible value explicitly, such as `-k 1` for a
two-network smoke test. The historical normal-approximation consensus filter
remains available through explicit `-pc` / `--p-value-consensus`, but it is
deprecated and cannot be combined with `-k`.

The default `K=6` is a density-favoring engineering setting for the standard
100-network workflow, not a p-value, FDR guarantee, or universal biological
optimum. See the [compact BRCA100 consensus-recurrence analysis](benchmarks/brca100_consensus_recurrence_sweep/)
for its matched design, exact-tail comparison, topology evidence, provenance,
and limitations. Record both `K` and the number of input networks when
reporting a result, and reconsider the setting when the number of networks
changes.

### Repeated subsampling of observations

The standard CWL/Python workflow now builds each input network from a fixed-size
subset sampled **without replacement**. By default, each network uses
`m = ceil(0.8 * N)` distinct observations, where `N` is the number of eligible
observations after any conditional selection. Thus, BRCA100 uses 80 of its 100
samples. The MI significance threshold and optional noise-correction variance are
calculated using the actual sampled `m`.

For every seed, SJARACNe draws a uniform fixed-size subset with a partial
Fisher-Yates shuffle, keeps the selected columns in their original order, and
recomputes ranks on that subset before adaptive-partitioning MI. Because an
observation can occur at most once, resampling no longer creates duplicated
joint expression points that can spuriously drive adaptive partitions.

Use `--subsample-fraction` to choose another fraction or `--subsample-size` to
set an exact count. For example:

```bash
sjaracne local -e expression.exp -g hubs.txt -n 100 \
  --subsample-fraction 0.8 -o results -tmp tmp

sjaracne local -e expression.exp -g hubs.txt -n 100 \
  --subsample-size 80 -o results -tmp tmp
```

At the native executable level, `-u 80%` and `-u 80` request the corresponding
without-replacement samples. Native runs use all observations when `-u` is
omitted. The old `-r` full-size bootstrap-with-replacement path remains available
only to reproduce legacy analyses; `-r` and `-u` cannot be combined.

In a manual CWL job, `subsample_spec` is a string, so quote both percentages and
exact counts (for example, `subsample_spec: "80%"` or `subsample_spec: "80"`).
The low-level `sjaracne.cwl` no longer supplies its historical implicit `-r 1`;
callers must choose `subsample_spec`, explicitly request legacy `sample_number`,
or omit both to analyze all observations. Legacy workflow names such as
`bootstrap_num` and the `TF_run_*.adj` filenames are retained for compatibility.

The 80% default is a pragmatic starting point, not a universal optimum. For an
important dataset, compare a small sensitivity range (for example, 64%, 80%, and
90%) and recalibrate any sample-size-dependent MI threshold for each choice.

### Estimator-matched AP-MI significance models

SJARACNe can optionally replace the inherited affine ARACNe p-value conversion
with a null calibrated against its exact C++ adaptive-partitioning estimator.
Pass an accepted model with `-M` / `--apmi-null-model`. Models are exact in the
sample count `m` and AP depth `-N`; a mismatch is rejected rather than
interpolated. For example, the packaged BRCA100-sized model uses `m=80` and
`Npar=40`:

```bash
sjaracne local -e expression.exp -g hubs.txt -n 100 \
  --subsample-size 80 -M SJARACNe/config/apmi_null/apmi_null_m00080_npar040.model \
  -o results -tmp tmp
```

The workflow p-value default remains `1e-7`. At that depth, the cutoff comes
from a fitted extreme tail and is beyond direct Monte Carlo validation; each
network records this extrapolation and the full model provenance in its header.
See [the calibration design, sweep results, and held-out BRCA100
validation](benchmarks/apmi_null_calibration/README.md). Without a model,
SJARACNe retains the historical affine calibration for backward compatibility
and prints a warning. An explicit native `-t` cutoff still bypasses either
p-value model.


## Examples to create a transcription factor network
**Note:** for testing purposes, the number of resampled networks (legacy option
`-n`) is set to 2 and the recurrence requirement is explicitly set to `-k 1`.
The default `K=6` requires at least six networks. These are smoke-test commands,
not recommended production settings. Note that there is no `/` at the end of
the `-o` option but there is a `/` at the end of the `-tmp` option. The default
per-subsample p-value (`-pb`) remains `1e-7` for compatibility.
